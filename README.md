# PolyTown

Example of using inheritance and polymorphism with various classes.
Use of classes exemplified through story-based text progression, in which
an otherwise peaceful town is ravaged by wolves. Citizens can make small talk and pay taxes.
As in real life, citizens are expected to hold jobs, which is represented by a Job class.
Classes are implemented in separate .h header and .cpp source files. 
There are two base classes - Citizen and Wolves, with Citizen having child classes Human and Others. 
Human and Others have their own respective derivative classes, including Vampire, Nobbs, Zombie, 
Troll and Dwarf. Furthermore, the Werewolf class exhibits multiple inheritance with respect to
two parent classes, Human and Wolf. 

Note that this project was originally developed with the CodeBlocks IDE and may not be compatible with
other IDEs (not thoroughly tested). 

You should unzip the folder. With CodeBlocks, the .cbp file can be opened and executed to run the program. 
The .h and .cpp files contained in the zip folder have also been shown separately to allow easy accessibility to the code, without the
need for downloading the zip folder and interest in executing the program. 

Attached in "Example Output" is example text output of a given run of the program.
